            <h4>What are the different motivation theories and give examples? (500 words)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Briefly introduce main motivation theories: Maslow's hierarchy of needs, the two-factor theory by Herzberg, McClelland's theory of needs, the Goal-setting theory, the Expectancy theory.</li>
                <li>These theories can be demonstrated for instance by explaining each theory in 1-2 sentences.</li>
                <li>Give 1 in-life case for each theory to show the work usage of the theory.</li>
                <li>A pyramid appears to be devised by the paraphrase of Maslow's theory, in which the two most fundamental forms of needs, namely, physiological and safety needs are to be satisfied before higher needs start to emerge. Another way is paying employees a salary that is better than that of their peers, and that the company will not sack them before fulfilling their need for esteem.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For example:</p>
            <p>According to the two-factor theory proposed by Herzberg, the motivational factors should be linked to hygiene factors such as pay and job security. These factors have to be combined with motivators like growth and recognition. A good example is acknowledging employees’ efforts by providing fair compensation and providing them with multiple growth opportunities.</p>
            
            <h4>What is the concept of corporate social responsibility given today's example? (500 words)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>CSR means that a company has to take care of all its stakeholders as well as its environment.</li>
                <li>Highlight the significance of CSR in the current environment - changing social norms and regards to social responsibility, controlling the company reputation/brand, attracting and retaining staff and risk mitigation.</li>
                <li>Give examples of CSR in practice today: Environmental actions (green measures, low carbon impact); ethical business chains (no child labor, staff decent treatment); corporate charity (donations, volunteer jobs, NGO partners); diversity, equity, and inclusion programs; responsible marketing/advertising.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For example:</p>
            <p>Companies that emulate Patagonia's values, like Patagonia, heavily invest in ecological CSR practices such as environmentally responsible manufacturing that ensures the products at any stage of their production are ethically made. This ensures that the risks of negative publicity are controlled and they also have a potential for attracting customers and talent who are fully aligned with the core values of Patagonia.</p>

            <h4>1. Define demand elasticity and then explain cross, price, and income elasticity in decisions in management. (500 words)</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Define demand elasticity:</strong> Demand elasticity measures how the quantity demanded of a good responds to changes in its price. It is expressed as the ratio of the percentage change in quantity demanded to the percentage change in price.
            </p>
            <h5>Cross Elasticity:</h5>
            <p>
                Cross elasticity of demand indicates how the demand for one product changes in response to the price change of another related product. A positive cross elasticity means the products are substitutes, while a negative cross elasticity means they are complementary. Managers can use cross elasticity to predict how the demand for their products will respond to price changes of related goods.
            </p>
            <h5>Price Elasticity:</h5>
            <p>
                Price elasticity of demand measures the sensitivity of the quantity demanded to price changes. If demand is elastic, a price change results in a significant change in quantity demanded. If inelastic, the quantity demanded is less responsive to price changes. Managers can use price elasticity to determine the potential impact of pricing decisions on revenues.
            </p>
            <h5>Income Elasticity:</h5>
            <p>
                Income elasticity of demand assesses how demand varies with changes in consumer income. Normal goods have positive income elasticity, while inferior goods have negative income elasticity. Managers can use income elasticity to forecast demand changes based on expected shifts in consumer incomes.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Importance for Managerial Decisions:</strong> Understanding these elasticity concepts is crucial for managers in making pricing strategies, revenue forecasts, and market predictions. Managers must consider substitutes, consumer incomes, and market saturation when making decisions based on elasticity.
            </p>
            <h4>2. What is the concept of national income? (500 words)</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Define National Income:</strong> National income measures the total economic activity in a country, including production, expenditure, income, and investment over a specified period, usually one year. It represents the total monetary value of all final goods and services produced.
            </p>
            <h5>Measures like GDP, GNP, NI, and PI:</h5>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>GDP (Gross Domestic Product):</strong> Measures the value of economic production within a country's borders.</li>
                    <li><strong>GNP (Gross National Product):</strong> Includes all production by a country's residents, regardless of location.</li>
                    <li><strong>NI (National Income):</strong> Estimates a country's total earnings, minus depreciation.</li>
                    <li><strong>PI (Personal Income):</strong> The total income received by households.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h5>Components of National Income:</h5>
            <p>
                National income includes wages, profits, rents, corporate taxes, and owner incomes, all contributing to the production output.
            </p>
            <h5>Uses and Limitations:</h5>
            <p>
                National income data is used for measuring economic growth, comparing living standards, and informing government policy. However, it has limitations such as difficulty in capturing the underground economy, quality of goods, environmental impact, and income distribution changes.
            </p>
            <h5>Importance for Business Managers:</h5>
            <p>
                National income trends are crucial for business managers as they indicate economic growth, business cycles, consumer purchasing power, and other factors essential for strategic planning and financial decisions.

            <h4>1. Marginal costing: Explain, "Marginal costing is a cost presentation and cost analysis technique." What are the limitations and merits of marginal costing? (500 words)</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Introduction (100 words):</strong><br>
                Marginal costing is a method used to determine how profit levels change due to various factors, including volume, cost, and selling price. It is instrumental in business decision-making as it differentiates between variable and fixed costs, simplifying the analysis compared to absorption costing.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Expound on the idea (150 words):</strong><br>
                In marginal costing, fixed costs are treated as period costs, while only variable costs are used in inventory valuation and the calculation of the cost of goods sold. This method aids decision-makers in various scenarios, such as introducing new products, making in-house production decisions, and identifying super profits in new markets.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Merits (100 words):</strong><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Simplifies accounting under absorption costing.</li>
                    <li>Assists in making decisions to maximize profits.</li>
                    <li>Avoids complications related to inventory valuation and its impact on profits.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Limitations (100 words):</strong><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unit costs may be understated as costs are allocated to items rather than specific products.</li>
                    <li>Inventory valuation does not align with accounting standards, as it is not accurately reflected in the books.</li>
                    <li>Distorted earnings figures compared to absorption costing, making them unsuitable for external reporting.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Conclusion (50 words):</strong><br>
                While marginal costing is valuable for internal decision-making, its limitations in inventory valuation and external reporting reduce its applicability in these areas. However, it remains a useful tool for managerial decisions.

            <h4>2. Discuss two functional budgets. (500 words)</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Outline two critical budgets (100 words):</strong><br>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sales budget:</strong> Projects the volume and value of sales.</li>
                    <li><strong>Production budget:</strong> Determines the number of units to be produced and the required inputs such as raw materials and labor.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Sales budget (200 words):</strong><br>
                The sales budget is based on sales forecasts and production volumes. It considers the quantities of products to be sold, their unit prices, and the product mix. The production budget is a key factor to consider in this stage, assisting in the scheduling and planning for the sales team's activities.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Production budget (200 words):</strong><br>
                The production budget outlines the quantities to be produced and the associated costs. It takes into account the sales budget, inventory levels, and includes estimates for labor input, cost variables, and overhead. Additionally, it incorporates the purchases budget and material cost budget, saving time and enhancing production capacity.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Conclusion (50 words):</strong><br>
                Both the sales and production budgets are interconnected, leading to efficient planning of resources and costs. Together, they facilitate better management and execution of business operations.

                The fiscal policy plays a crucial role in managing economic conditions by adjusting government spending and taxation to influence the economy. During a recession, fiscal policy can help reduce deficits and stimulate economic growth by increasing government expenditure or reducing taxes, which boosts aggregate demand, output, and employment.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Effects of Fiscal Policy:</strong><br>
                Increased public spending stimulates the economy through a cycle of production and consumption. Counter-cyclical fiscal policies, such as increased spending or tax cuts, can help curb inflation but may also exacerbate a recession if not managed properly. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Automatic Stabilizers:</strong><br>
                These include measures like unemployment benefits and progressive taxes that naturally counterbalance economic fluctuations without additional government intervention. They help stabilize income during downturns and maintain demand.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Job Market Impact:</strong><br>
                Fiscal policy aims to create full employment without triggering uncontrolled inflation. It supports job creation through government spending on infrastructure and public services.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>
                Fiscal policy, in conjunction with monetary policy, is vital for managing economic stability and employment. However, excessive use of fiscal measures can lead to risks such as high public debt and inflation.

            <h4>2. What are the types of international businesses? Cite examples. (500 words)</h4>
            <p>
                International business encompasses all commercial activities that occur across national borders. These activities include exporting, importing, multinational corporations, joint ventures, and foreign subsidiaries.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Exporters and Importers:</strong><br>
                Exporters sell goods and services to other countries, while importers buy goods and services from abroad. Examples include companies like Boeing (exporter) and Walmart (importer).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Multinational Corporations (MNCs):</strong><br>
                MNCs operate in multiple countries, leveraging local advantages. Examples include Coca-Cola and Toyota, which have operations worldwide.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Joint Ventures:</strong><br>
                These are collaborative agreements between companies from different countries to share resources and knowledge. An example is Sony Ericsson, a joint venture between Sony and Ericsson.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Foreign Subsidiaries:</strong><br>
                These are branches of a parent company established in another country. For example, Apple's subsidiary in Ireland handles European operations.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Globalization and International Business:</strong><br>
                Globalization has expanded international business by creating worldwide connections and partnerships, enhancing market reach and consumer access. Examples include successful mergers like Disney and Pixar.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>
                Different international business models function as bridges between countries, meeting global consumer needs and fostering economic integration. They play a pivotal role in today's interconnected global economy.
